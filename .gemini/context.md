## Project Status Analysis

### Frontend Structure
- **Root Layout (`app/layout.jsx`):** Wraps all pages, includes `<Header />` and `<Footer />`.
- **Landing Page (`app/page.jsx`):** Contains a search bar and marketing content. The "Find Internships" button is not yet functional.
- **Internship List Page (`app/internships/page.jsx`):** Fetches and displays internship offers from the Supabase `offers` table.
- **Internship Detail Page (`app/internships/[id]/page.jsx`):** Displays the details of a single internship offer.

### Components
- **Header (`components/Header.jsx`):** Provides navigation links to "Internships", "Companies", and "About", along with "Login" and "Sign Up" buttons. Includes a mobile-friendly menu.
- **Footer (`components/Footer.jsx`):** Contains navigation and social media links.

### Backend and Data
- The frontend is connected to a Supabase backend.
- It retrieves data from the `offers` and `companies` tables.

### Missing Features (MVP)
- **Admin Panel:** The admin panel for CRUD operations on internships is missing.
- **Admin Authentication:** Password protection for the admin panel is not implemented.
- **Search Functionality:** The "Find Internships" feature on the landing page is not implemented.
- **Static Pages:** The "Companies" and "About" pages are linked but likely not yet created.

### Out of Scope (Phase 1)
- User accounts ("Login" and "Sign Up") are not part of the MVP.
